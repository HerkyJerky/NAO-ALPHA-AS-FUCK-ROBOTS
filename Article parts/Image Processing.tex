\section{Image Processing}
This section's purpose is to explain the mechanisms, algorithms and mathematics behind the processing of images made by the Nao.
A brief introduction to the subsections follows before heading into the details.\\ \\
First the image is preprocessed. In this step the image is converted into a new image consisting only of green, yellow and white pixels. Any background noise is removed.\\
Second the fieldlines get isolated and using Hough transforms the cornerpoints are extracted.\\
Third the goalposts get isolated and the location of the foot of each post - if visible - gets determined.\\
Lastly the distance gets calculated using the camera angle and height, the resolution of the image and the coordinates of the previously extracted landmarks.
